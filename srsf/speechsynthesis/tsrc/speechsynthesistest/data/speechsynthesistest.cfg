test InitialiseSynthesis KErrNone Las Vegas, USA - Nokia today introduced a trimmer fold model to its Nokia Nseries line up, the Nokia N76, a new smartphone that brings the complete Nokia Nseries experience to a sleeker body, with little compromise. Using premium materials to enclose world-class Nokia Nseries features and experiences, Nokia has created a very eye-catching device. We did not want to compromise any of the key Nokia Nseries experiences when we designed the stylish Nokia N76 multimedia computer, said Pekka Pohjakallio, vice-president, Multimedia, Nokia. He continued, Nokia Nseries consumers are bleeding edge technology users and with them in mind we want to offer intelligent and entertaining multimedia functionality in an easy to use, ultra slim package.
